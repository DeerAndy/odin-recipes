            <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>40 oz. marinara sauce, see notes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Lasagna Noodles & Cheese Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles, cooked according to package instructions</li>
            <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>instructions</h2>
    
    <h3>Prep Work</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9×13 inch baking dish. Layer 4 lasagna noodles on top. Spread ⅓ of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat layers twice more, ending with meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Bake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
